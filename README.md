# GameStop-s-Digital-Transformation-Journey

The objective of this project is to analyze GameStop's digital transformation strategy in response to the changing landscape of the gaming industry. We will explore how GameStop, once the dominant physical game store in America, faced challenges due to competition from digital distribution services and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We will examine the factors that led to a decline in GameStop's stock price and how the intervention of Gen-Z investors provided a lifeline for the company. With a fresh opportunity at hand, GameStop needs to redefine its goals and reimagine its business processes to thrive in the digital era.

Goals:

Survival and Digital Resilience:
Transform 60% of GameStop's business to online streaming by mid-2024.
Garner at least 15% of the market's customer base by the end of 2025.
Increase net annual revenue by at least $600 million within three years.
Business Processes:

Restructure operations to become a provider of PC game bundles on a subscription basis.
Leverage artificial intelligence to analyze user behavior and recommend personalized game bundles.
Collaborate with game developers to explore niche content and less popular video game releases.

Finance department reallocates resources from physical stores to support technology initiatives.
IT department creates, deploys, and maintains cloud architecture and services.
